# Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects designed to solve real-world problems using popular datasets. The projects included are Iris Flower Classification, Titanic Survival Prediction, Car Price Prediction, and Fake News Prediction. Each project is aimed at providing hands-on experience with machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification

A project to classify Iris flowers into three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

#### Features:
- Utilize the Iris flower dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Train a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on these measurements.
- Ideal for introductory learning experiences in classification tasks.

#### Usage:
1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets.
3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or support vector machine).
4. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction

A project to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using the Titanic dataset.

#### Features:
- Utilize the Titanic dataset, which includes passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival outcome.
- Construct a predictive model to determine survival based on these features.
- Provides insights into survival patterns among Titanic passengers.

#### Usage:
1. Load the Titanic dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural network).
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

### 3. Car Price Prediction

A project to predict car prices based on various factors.

#### Features:
- Utilize a car price dataset that includes features such as brand reputation, car features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more.
- Train a machine learning model to predict car prices based on these factors.
- Valuable for learning regression techniques and feature engineering.

#### Usage:
1. Load the car price dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, or gradient boosting).
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

### 4. Fake News Prediction

A project to classify news articles as real or fake using the Fake News Prediction dataset.

#### Features:
- Utilize the Fake News Prediction dataset, which includes columns such as Title, Text, and Label (Fake or Real).
- Train a machine learning model to identify misinformation.
- Supports efforts to enhance information integrity and combat fake news.

#### Usage:
1. Load the Fake News Prediction dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., text cleaning, tokenization, vectorization).
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, logistic regression, or neural network).
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
