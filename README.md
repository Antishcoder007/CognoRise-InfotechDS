# Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects designed to solve real-world problems using popular datasets. The projects included are Iris Flower Classification, Titanic Survival Prediction, Car Price Prediction, and Fake News Prediction. Each project is aimed at providing hands-on experience with machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification

A project to classify Iris flowers into three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

#### Features:
- Utilize the Iris flower dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Train a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on these measurements.
- Ideal for introductory learning experiences in classification tasks.

#### Usage:
1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets.
3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or support vector machine).
4. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
